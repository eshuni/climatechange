Data Visualization Project - Weather Trends
Live Demo 
Flask app 
	Start the Flask app by python app.py 
	Run the link http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Project Description 
	For this second project, your task will be to "tell a story" through data visualizations.
	Unlike the first project, where you focused on using the "Analytics Paradigm" to explore relationships in "report form", this project should be more focused on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves.
	Just as with the first project, you will be asked to conduct a 15 minute presentation and 5 minute questions that lays out your theme, coding approach, and final dashboard.
	You may choose a project of any theme, but we encourage you to think broadly. The universe is wide and expansive. Don't limit yourself to what you know.
	You will have roughly two weeks to complete this project. You will present your final work on Saturday (Dec 02, 2019). You will have ample time in class to work with your group (but expect to put in some long nights in the days ahead).
	Project Requirements Your visualization must include a Python Flask powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and at least one database (MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.)
	You will make a dashboard using some combination of D3, Leaflet and Plotly, which shows multiple visualizations of related data.
	Your project may include JS libraries that we did not cover.
	Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records of raw data.
	Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g. menus, dropdowns, textboxes, etc.)
	Your final dashboard should ideally include at least three views
