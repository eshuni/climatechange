Project Description 

	For this second project, we will be to "tell a story" through data visualizations.

	We focused on using the "Analytics Paradigm" to explore relationships in "report form", this project is more focused on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves.

	You may choose a project of any theme, but we encourage you to think broadly. The universe is wide and expansive. Don't limit yourself to what you know.

	Project Requirements includes a Python Flask powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and at least one database MySQL.

	Our dashboard uses some combination of D3, Motion Chart Library and Plotly, which shows multiple visualizations of related data.

	Your project may include JS libraries that we did not cover.

	The purpose of this project is to determine if Climate Change is happening through data weather data from 2014 to 2019. By comparing West, SouthEast, SouthWest, and East Regions. The examine if the weather temperature of 2014 is that different from 2019.
